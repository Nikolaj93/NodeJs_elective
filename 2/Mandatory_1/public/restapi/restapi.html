            <p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 20px;">Restful web service:</p>
            <p>When creating a RESTFUL web service, there are certain things it should contain and one of the things is HTTP methods.
                Methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. When you meet a RESTFUL web service, you can expect it to have these capabilities. Also called CRUD operations.
                Let's say that we have a website where a server contains users of some sort. We should expect that when we try to issue a GET request to /user/ that the server returns a list all registered users.
                When we issue a GET request for /user/3, the server should return the user details of user number 3. If we issue a DELETE request with /user/3 the server should delete user 3.<br><br>
         </p>     
         <p style="font-weight: 800; font-size: 1.3em; padding-top: 20px;">Postman:</p>
            <p><em>Postman</em> is an application that helps developers develop better API's through a simplified user interface. 
                You could to some degree interact with a RESTFUL API through the URL alone, but is unecessarily hard. Interacting with the API through Postman makes life a lot easier.<br><br>
                To demonstrate some REST API usages, I've created several URL's to retrieve ressources of students following the localhost:/port/restapi/collection. It's possible to use the CRUD operations, namely create (POST), read (GET), update (PUT) and delete.
                I've hardcoded some students into an array to provide with some initial data.</p>
